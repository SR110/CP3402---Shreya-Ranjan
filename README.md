# Learning Activities & Resources
Since it was the first practical, I just found a CSS Template and edited it. I did not do any LinkedIn Courses because I had the basics of html, css and javascript as a strong foundation. I took some help from online sources for replacing the image below the navigation bar as I was not able to make the change at first.

# Content Insights
I chose a food-related template, the parent theme, and made some edits to make it a vending machine business website, the child theme. My business is focussed on vending machines that dispense metal straws and bottles and encourages Singaporean residents to choose a better alternative to plastic items. 

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week I learnt how to use existing CSS templates and use their layout to match my requirements. I also improved on my html, css and javascript skills and improved on my debugging skills. I also learnt how to upload to GitHub from Visual Studio Code (VSC).
